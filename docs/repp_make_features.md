## repp make features

Find or build a plasmid from its constituent features

```
repp make features "[feature],...[featureN]" [flags]
```

### Examples

```
repp make features "BBa_R0062,BBa_B0034,BBa_C0040,BBa_B0010,BBa_B0012" --backbone pSB1C3 --enzymes "EcoRI,PstI" --dbs igem
```

### Options

```
  -b, --backbone string   backbone to insert the fragments into. Can either be an entry 
                          in one of the dbs or a file on the local filesystem.
  -d, --dbs string        comma separated list of sequence databases by name
  -e, --enzymes string    comma separated list of enzymes to linearize the backbone with.
                          The backbone must be specified. 'repp ls enzymes' prints a list of
                          recognized enzymes.
  -x, --exclude string    keywords for excluding fragments
  -h, --help              help for features
  -p, --identity int      %-identity threshold (see 'blastn -help') (default 98)
  -o, --out string        output file name
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string   path to a config file
  -v, --verbose         write DEBUG logs
```
