## repp make fragments

Build a plasmid from its constituent fragments

### Synopsis

Prepare a list of fragments for assembly via Gibson Assembly. Fragments are
checked for existing homology with their neighbors and are prepared for
assembly with PCR.

```
repp make fragments [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -b, --backbone string   backbone to insert the fragments into. Can either be an entry 
                          in one of the dbs or a file on the local filesystem.
  -d, --dbs string        comma separated list of sequence databases by name
  -e, --enzymes string    comma separated list of enzymes to linearize the backbone with.
                          The backbone must be specified. 'repp ls enzymes' prints a list of
                          recognized enzymes.
  -h, --help              help for fragments
  -i, --in string         input file name (FASTA or Genbank)
  -o, --out string        output file name
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -c, --config string   path to a config file
  -v, --verbose         whether to log results to stdout
```
